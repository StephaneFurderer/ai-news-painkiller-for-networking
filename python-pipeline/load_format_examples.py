1/ Customer interviews > your brilliant idea
Talk to 100 potential customers before writing code. Your assumptions are probably wrong.

2/ MVP should be embarrassingly simple
If you're not slightly embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.

3/ Distribution is harder than building
Great product + no distribution = failed startup. Plan go-to-market from day 1.

4/ Cash flow > vanity metrics
Revenue matters more than downloads, users, or press coverage.

5/ Find a co-founder you'd want as a friend
You'll spend more time with them than family. Choose wisely.

üí° WHY THIS MATTERS:
VR adoption has been slow due to cost and comfort issues. Quest 3 addresses both with:
‚Ä¢ 40% lighter design
‚Ä¢ 4K displays per eye
‚Ä¢ Competitive pricing vs Apple Vision Pro

üìä BY THE NUMBERS:
‚Ä¢ VR market expected to reach $87B by 2030
‚Ä¢ 31% of US adults interested in VR for work
‚Ä¢ Average session time increased to 45 minutes

If you're in product development, consider how VR/AR might enhance your user experience. Even simple 3D visualizations can differentiate your product.

Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system sounds complex, but it's surprisingly straightforward. Here's how to build one that actually works.

## What You'll Need
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- 30 minutes of your time

## Step 1: Set Up Your Knowledge Base
The magic of RAG is giving your AI relevant context. Start simple:

```python
documents = [
    "Your company's FAQ",
    "Product documentation",
    "Best practices guide"
]
```

## Step 2: Create Embeddings
Convert your text into vectors that capture semantic meaning:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

embeddings = []
for doc in documents:
    response = client.embeddings.create(
        model="text-embedding-ada-002",
        input=doc
    )
    embeddings.append(response.data[0].embedding)
```

## Step 3: Build the Retrieval
When a user asks a question, find the most relevant documents:

```python
def find_relevant_docs(query, top_k=3):
    # Convert query to embedding
    query_embedding = get_embedding(query)

    # Calculate similarities
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, embeddings)

    # Return top matches
    return get_top_documents(similarities, top_k)
```

## Step 4: Generate with Context
Now the AI has relevant information to work with:

```python
def answer_question(query):
    relevant_docs = find_relevant_docs(query)

    prompt = f\"\"\"
    Context: {relevant_docs}
    Question: {query}
    Answer:
    \"\"\"

    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
```

## Why This Works
RAG combines the best of both worlds:
- **Retrieval**: Finds specific, factual information
- **Generation**: Creates natural, contextual responses

## Next Steps
1. Add more documents to your knowledge base
2. Experiment with different embedding models
3. Fine-tune your retrieval strategy
4. Add a simple web interface

That's it! You now have a working RAG system. The key is starting simple and iterating based on real usage.
