linkedin_post,Productivity Tips,"💡 3 productivity hacks that changed my workflow:

1️⃣ Time-blocking: Schedule focused work in 2-hour chunks
   → No meetings, no slack, pure deep work

2️⃣ The 2-minute rule: If it takes <2 min, do it now
   → Prevents small tasks from becoming big problems

3️⃣ Weekly reviews: Every Friday, reflect and plan
   → What worked? What didn't? Adjust for next week

Small changes → massive impact on output quality.

twitter_thread,Startup Lessons,"🧵 5 hard lessons from building my first startup:

1/ Customer interviews > your brilliant idea
Talk to 100 potential customers before writing code. Your assumptions are probably wrong.

2/ MVP should be embarrassingly simple
If you're not slightly embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.

3/ Distribution is harder than building
Great product + no distribution = failed startup. Plan go-to-market from day 1.

4/ Cash flow > vanity metrics
Revenue matters more than downloads, users, or press coverage.

5/ Find a co-founder you'd want as a friend
You'll spend more time with them than family. Choose wisely.
